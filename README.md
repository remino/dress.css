## Just write HTML and make it look good

Introducing **<mark>sem.css</mark>**, a minimalist class-less stylesheet that makes your pages look good only by writing HTML.

This simple stylesheet was born from three things:

- How the rendering of HTML without CSS hasn't changed much since the first Web browser in 1991.
- How common readers in some browsers (like the one in Safari) simplifies the styling the pages to focus on legibility.
- How writing CSS for simple pages is painful or at least time-consuming.

Much of this stylesheet was inspired from [_new.css_](https://newcss.net/), with a few changes to vertical rhythm and markup for button links, and no external fonts.
