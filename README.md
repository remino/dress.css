# sem.css Semantic Style

**Minimalist class-less styling only with HTML.**

This simple stylesheet was born from three things:

- How the rendering of HTML without CSS hasn't changed much since the first Web browser in 1991.
- How common readers in some browsers (like the one in Safari) simplifies the styling the pages to focus on legibility.
- How writing CSS for simple pages is painful or at least time-consuming.

Introducing **<mark>sem.css</mark>**, a minimalist class-less stylesheet that makes your pages look good only by writing HTML.

Much of this stylesheet was inspired from [_new.css_](https://newcss.net/), with a few changes to vertical rhythm and markup for button links, and no external fonts.

## Features

- **Small**: Less than 2.5 KiB, gzipped.
- **Class-less**: No need to add classes to your HTML elements.
- **Modern**: Uses CSS variables, viewport sizes, and flexbox.
- **Readable**: Focus on the content, not the style.
- **Responsive**: Uses relative units, works well on all screen sizes.
- **Accessible**: Uses semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles.
- **Printable**: Looks good on paper.
- **Localizable**: Works both with left-to-right and right-to-left languages.
- **Customizable**: Add your own styles on top of it, or add a theme by changing variables.

## Usage

Add the stylesheet to your HTML and write your content:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/semcss@0.1.0/dist/sem.css">
```

To know which HTML tags are handled by this stylesheet, see _[Elements](elements/)_.
